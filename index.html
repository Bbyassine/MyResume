    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I am a motivated undergrad with an associate degree in computer science from Sierra College, California. Over the past four years, I have dedicated myself to acquiring comprehensive knowledge and skills in the field.

        Alongside my academic pursuits, I have had the opportunity to work as a Business Developer in a B2B company. In this role, I honed my skills in market research, client acquisition, and relationship management.
        
        I had the role of Account Manager at Quicktext within the hospitality sector, specializing in integrating chatbots into hotel websites and social media platforms to enhance efficiency and guest engagement. 
        
        I am now a Product Owner for the data unit at Quicktext, collaborating with developers to achieve sprints following Agile methodologies.</p>
